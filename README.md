## Cloud Adventure: Race to Cloud Castle
*This story is in progress. To start from the beginning, visit adventure.acloud.guru.*

The cave is almost pitch black. But not too dark for you to snag the *SAPPHIRE* glimmering just inside the entrance. 

But when you lift the stone from its resting place, a hideous scuttering sound fills the air. You have disturbed something with many legs and a mean disposition. It's a horrifying software bug, one of the worst you've ever seen.

The bug drools green juice, a full-blown production outage, on the floor of the cave. Your shoes begin to melt. 

You think quickly: can your newfound cloud skills dispatch the bug alone, or should you see if the old wizard is still around?

If you decide to fight the bug on your own, deploy this AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)application in your AWS account using CloudFormation, then test the created Lambda function in the AWS console. (Use a default test event, inputs don't matter.)

If you decide to call for help, deploy the application, then run a GET call against the "help" endpoint of the deployed API.
